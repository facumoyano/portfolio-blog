I am a web developer with experience in e-commerce using Magento, as well as foreign trade software development using TypeScript, Node.js and React. My Magento experience includes theme customization, payment integration, and performance and user experience improvement. In my foreign trade software development work, I have implemented features such as container tracking and contract generation to help customers optimize their operations. I am passionate about using my expertise in both areas to create customized solutions that help customers achieve their business objectives.
